# 🧠 PDF RAG API with Pinecone and Gemini

This project provides a RESTful API to upload PDF documents, extract and chunk their content, index the content into a **Pinecone vector database**, and perform **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** using **Google Gemini** models.

---

## 🚀 Features

* 📄 Upload and parse multiple PDF files (max 20 files, 1000 pages total)
* 🔍 Query uploaded content using vector similarity via Pinecone
* 🧩 Auto-chunking of text for better indexing
* 🤖 Semantic RAG using Gemini 2.0/2.5 (Flash)
* 📦 Clean separation of endpoints: upload, query, and RAG

---

## 🏗️ Tech Stack

* **Flask** – Python web framework
* **PyMuPDF (fitz)** – PDF text extraction
* **Pinecone** – Vector database for semantic search
* **Google Gemini API** – For smart query generation and answer synthesis
* **uuid, re, os** – Utility & system libraries

## ⚙️ Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file with the following:

```env
PINECONE_API_KEY=your_pinecone_api_key
PINECONE_INDEX_NAME=your_index_name
GEMINI=your_gemini_api_key
```

Also configure `PINECONE_NAMESPACE` in Flask config before running the app:

```python
app.config['PINECONE_NAMESPACE'] = 'your_namespace'
```

## 📡 API Endpoints

### 1. `GET /`

* Health check.
* Returns: `"api is running"`

---

### 2. `POST /upload-pdfs`

* Upload 1–20 PDF files for parsing and indexing.
* Max 1000 pages total.

#### Form Data

| Field | Type    | Description           |
| ----- | ------- | --------------------- |
| files | File\[] | One or more PDF files |

```bash
curl -F "files=@file1.pdf" -F "files=@file2.pdf" http://localhost:5000/upload-pdfs
```

---

### 3. `POST /query`

* Perform a vector search using Pinecone.

#### JSON Body

```json
{
  "query": "What is the return policy?"
}
```

---

### 4. `POST /rag`

* Complete RAG flow:

  * Generate semantic search query via Gemini
  * Perform vector search
  * Get final answer using context + original prompt

#### JSON Body

```json
{
  "prompt": "Tell me about the refund process mentioned in the uploaded documents"
}
```

#### Returns

A well-formed answer generated by Gemini using the uploaded PDF context.
